Overall, I was unsurprised by how this assignment went. 
The code was quite simple, so it was easy to predict the outcome. 
The hardest part was creating a test for my functions.

I ended up creating a local HTML file that logged the output in the console.

I suppose that this kit might be useful in the real world because it might
be useful to use smaller functions inside of larger more complex
functions.
